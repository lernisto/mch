# Instructions: Run this script as the root user after every package install.
# Note: If you built the setup_install_dirs.c helper and SetUID=root you can
#    run this command as a package user.
# Overview: We initially set up new directories so that other packages can 
#   install into them. The next time we run this script it will detect if the
#   directory has things that belong to someone else in it and change the
#   owner to root so as to protect the directory from removal.
#
# find directories that do not belong to the install group and process them

# Find directories that are not owned by root and process them

    else
        # The directory is not shared so all we want to confirm is the mode
        # since the other loop ensures the group membership if that was changed
